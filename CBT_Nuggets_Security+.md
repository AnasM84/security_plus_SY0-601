# Social Engineering Techniques

## 001. Introduction to Social Engineering
- impersonating someone else to trick somebody (to click link, make a phone call, share information).
  * *couple of examples*:
    * identity fraud
    * false payment invoice

## 002. Phishing and Related Attacks
Emails with intent to compromise person or computer, by clicking a link, or opening an attachment in such mail.  
**NOT** really a *spam*, spam is advertising.

- **Spear phishing** a targeted phishing.
- **Whaling** a targeted phishing for important person (big fish).
- **Watering hole attack** observing/guessing which sites organization is using and infecting one of them with malware.
- **Vishing** phishing done using phone (voice).
- **Smishing** phishing done using SMS.
- **Pharming** credential harvesting by tricking user, where user inputs his credentials (for example: bank) into a faked site that looks legit, but it's not.

ways of reducing phishing attacks:
- user training
- email security

## 003. Low Tech attacks
- **dumpster diving** - can be prevented by *information disposal process* regarding hard drives, thumb drives, papers,
so any information that is no longer needed can be properly managed and destroyed.
- **tailgating** or **piggybacking** - trick to gain physical (unauthorized) access - can be prevented by "one person, one card at the time" policy
- **typo squatting** - incorrect website - site with a typo in it that tricks user into a faked site that looks legit, but it's not.

## 004. Why Social Engineering Works

- **authority** - or *presumed* target more willing to comply in presence of authority
- **intimidation** - 
- **consensus** - "everyone does it"
- **scarcity** - "limited lifetime offer"
- **trust** - or familiarity
- **urgency** - no time to think (this is implied in other reasons)
